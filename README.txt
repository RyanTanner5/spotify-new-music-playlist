one thing i really miss from my old ipod music pirate days was ituens allowed you to make dynamic playlists off of parameters. so i had a playlist that contained everything that was added within the last 3 months. so i got to listen to all the tracks and b-sides and whatever i threw into my library. and the shuffle button worked really well. i would grab colections of music from people and just throw random stuff in and then tag any songs i really like and any songs i really hated to add to other playlist or nuke. iv tried adding all the stuff from my collection to spotify and then just hit shuffel from the library level but i swear it picks out the singles or most listened to stuff and i end up hearing the same songs over and over.
i wish i could force spotify to rebuild the weekly discover or release radar lists by clicking a button. i think that would partially solve some of the anoyance factors. but it just feels like there is a lot of features that other media apps had or other streaming services like youtube just do way better
hummm. nate didnt you do soemthing with spotify api. i wonder if i could build what i really want... make a api that takes all the artiss i follow and build a playlist from stuff released in the last 3 months that i can then shuffel. like a master version of the release radar
